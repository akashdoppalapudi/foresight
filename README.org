* Introduction
    
    foresight (f7t) is a tool for predicting text input from a predefined list of words.
    currently, it will look for the word list at 'file:/usr/share/dict/words' and make a trie to store the words.

* Usage

    The tool is currently in development and is not ready for use.
    However you can try it out by compiling the source code and running it.

    #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    $ git clone --recursive git@github.com:notshriram/foresight.git foresight
    $ cd foresight
    $ mkdir build && cd build
    $ cmake ..
    $ make
    $ ./foresight
    > 
    #+END_EXAMPLE
